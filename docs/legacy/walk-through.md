# Accessibility Walk through

The following document discribes a primary journey through accessibility.cloud. In that is can be the basis for a small ScreenCast. The following list is quiet extensive and includes features that still await implementation. Features that should be working already are marked with a checkmark.

## Browsing

- [x] Open [AC](https://accessibility.cloud/) with a modern browser
- [x] The page loads quickly and without entering a password.
- [ ] You can read documentation and introductional content about the service.

- [ ] ...but, until further work on the [security of back-end](https://trello.com/c/a6ROhrCH/209-prevent-un-moderated-input-of-javascript-code-into-source-mapping-definitions), we have to restrict the signup
- [ ] you learn that your account is waiting for verification with and also see a contact email-address for support (that will be forwarded to holger)
- [ ] once an administrator saw your request on the "[pending verfications-list](https://trello.com/c/gEo7n1nJ/210-added-a-pending-user-verifications-list-for-administrators)" and verifies your account, you can login.

## Creating an Organization

- [x] You learn that before doing anything meaningful, you have to create or join an *Organizations*
- [ ] A member can invite/add you to an existing organization (or an entity for a single "individual").
- [x] Or, you can create a new organization.

## Creating a Data Source

- [ ] You learn that to share data, you need to create *a data source*.
- [x] You can create *a data source* for your new *Organization*.
- [ ] In the create data-source form, you see that each data-source requires a license.
- [ ] You can check the existing *predefined licenses*, but...
- [ ] ...you decided to add a new custom license for your data source.
- [ ] You create a license by filling out the form.
- [ ] In your data-source-settings you set your custom license.
- [ ] In your data-source-setting you also define, how frequently the source should be updated.

## Sharing Data Sources

- [x] You learn that you need to define how your data-source is mapped into the ac-format.
- [x] You learn that there is a generic [ac-format](ac-format.md) and how you can find additional documentation on that topic.
- [ ] You click a link to find more documentation [on github](https://github.com/sozialhelden/accessibility-cloud/tree/master/docs) and are happy to see that this is a freely accessible open source project.
- [x] You learn that you don't have to understand how to map your data – you can always find help from the ac-community through the support-email-address (or other channels like irc?).
- [x] You can update your data, so some members of the AC-community can then help you converting the data-format.
- [ ] You can initialize the source-import-definition from a list of templates for importing CSV and JSON.
- [x] You can edit the information in a textarea, but...
- [ ] …you can't save the updated definition until all the errors are fixed.
- [x] Once you updated the information you can press *import* and see that a new progress is now running in the background and indicates its process with a collection of progress bars.
- [ ] You understand that importing data is really complicated but are happy to find a link to the extensive documentation on importing data on github.
- [x] In the settings you also control which organizations can access the data source.

## Just confirm what the AC-people prepared

- You get a direct link to a page that shows how the staff of AC integrated your data source, you can preview the data and confirm your TOC to publish. This links gets open through an invitation Email.
- convert Holgers "google form" to a data-contributor sign up.

## API-Client example / Using the API

- [ ] You see the link the javascript-example code and its documentation.
- [ ] You follow the steps on the documentation:
- [ ] You clone the repository.
- [x] You open the example in the browser.
- [ ] You learn that the API tokens are missing.
- [x] You can copy the API-tokens from accessibility.cloud and quickly find where to insert them into the javascript code
- [x] You see that the javascript-code ist very small, easy to read and well documented.
